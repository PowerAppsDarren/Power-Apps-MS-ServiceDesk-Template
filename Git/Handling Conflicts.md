## Identifying the Conflict

When Git detects a conflict during a merge, it will mark the conflicting sections in your file with special markers[1]:
- `<<<<<<< HEAD` marks the beginning of your changes
- `=======` separates your changes from your coworker's changes
- `>>>>>>> feature-branch` marks the end of your coworker's changes

## Resolution Steps

**1. Examine the Conflict**
Open the conflicting file in your text editor. You'll see both sets of changes clearly marked with the conflict markers[4].

**2. Choose the Correct Changes**
You have three options[1]:
- Keep your changes
- Keep your coworker's changes
- Combine both changes

**3. Edit and Clean Up**
Remove all conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and ensure the file contains exactly what you want[4].

**4. Stage and Commit**
After resolving the conflict:
```bash
git add <filename>
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in <filename>"
```

## Best Practices

To minimize future conflicts[4]:
- Pull changes frequently from the shared branch
- Make small, focused commits
- Communicate with your team about which files you're working on

If you're unsure about which changes to keep, it's recommended to discuss with your coworker to ensure the best outcome for the project[4].
